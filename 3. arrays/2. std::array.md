> std::array is a container that represents arrays of fixed size. 

> std::array lends itself nicely to use in embedded systems, as memory can be statically allocated at compile-time.

##### In order to utilize std::array, you will need to include the array header:

      #include <array>

##### Creating a std::array

> The std::array container is prototyped on two elements: 

> the type that you want to be stored and the size of the array. 

> std::array containers of different sizes are viewed as different types by the compiler.

##### Declares an array of 10 ints. Size is always required
        std::array<int, 10> a1;
        
        
          Example :         
          #include<iostream>
          #include<array>
          using namespace std;
          using std::endl;


          int main(){
              std::array<int, 3> a = {1,2,3};
              cout << "size of array is " << a.size() << endl;
              std::array<string, 3> words = {"one","two","three"};
              for(auto word : words){
                  cout << word << endl;
              }
              return 0;
          }
