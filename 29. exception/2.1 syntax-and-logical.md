std::logic_error : preventable : cannot be thrown directly.



Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. 
It reports errors that are a consequence of faulty logic within the program such as violating 
logical preconditions or class invariants and may be preventable.

No standard library components throw this exception directly, 
but the exception types 
std::invalid_argument, 
std::domain_error, 
std::length_error, 
std::out_of_range, 
std::future_error, and 
std::experimental::bad_optional_access 
are derived from std::logic_error.
