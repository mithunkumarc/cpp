The inline specifier can be applied to variables as well as to functions. 
A variable declared inline has the same semantics as a function declared inline.


        #include <iostream>
        struct S { int x;};
        int main(){
          inline S s1 = S{321};
          S x2 = S{123};

        return 0;
        }


 * Inline function/variable instruct compiler to insert complete body of the function/value wherever that function got used in code.
