##### Release memory pointed by pointer-variable
        syntax : delete pointer-variable;  


    A* a = new A();
    delete a; //works, stored on heap
    
    // deleting memory allocated for array
    int* set = new int[100];     
    delete [] set;  
    
    
    A aa; (stored on stack)
    delete aa; //error    
    
    
    
    
     C++ supports these functions and also has two operators new and delete that perform the task of allocating and 
     freeing the memory in a better and easier way.
     
     
     Since it is programmer’s responsibility to deallocate dynamically allocated memory, 
     programmers are provided delete operator by C++ language.
     
> refer new operator , it allocated memory ,delete operator deallocates memory.
