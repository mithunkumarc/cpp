> Effect of Incrementing and Decrementing operators

> incrementing pointer will not increment address, it will points to memory location of next element.

> incrementing integer array pointer jumps 4 memory location, because next element appear after 4 bytes

> uses sizeof operator to move to next element


int* array = {1,2,3}



    int* array = new int[10]();
    array[0] = 100;
    array[1] = 200;
    array[2] = 300;
    std::cout << "incrementing array pointer" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "memory location : " << array << ", value : " << * array << std::endl;
    array++;
    std::cout << "memory location : " << array << ", value : " << * array << std::endl;
    array++;
    std::cout << "memory location : " << array << ", value : " << * array << std::endl;
    
    output :     
    incrementing array pointer
    memory location : 0x55da0c421e70, value : 100
    memory location : 0x55da0c421e74, value : 200

What Happens When You Increment or Decrement a Pointer?
The address contained in the pointer is incremented or decremented by the sizeof
the type being pointed to (and not necessarily a byte). This way, the compiler ensures
that the pointer never points to the middle or end of data placed in the memory; it
only points to the beginning.
If a pointer has been declared as
Type* pType = Address;
++pType would mean that pType contains (and hence points to) Address +
sizeof(Type)
