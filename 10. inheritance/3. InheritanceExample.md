public inheritance : 

            #include <iostream>
            class A{

            };
            class B : public A{

            };
            int main(){    

                return 0;
            }

inheritance between base as class and child as struct

            #include <iostream>
            class A{
                public:
                    int number = 10;
            };
            struct B : public A{

            };
            int main(){    
                B b;
                std::cout << "b number : " << b.number << std::endl;
                return 0;
            }
            
            output : 
            10
            
            
inheritance between class as child and base as struct. 

            #include <iostream>
            struct A{
                public:
                    int number = 10;
            };
            class B : A{
                //default inheritance is private , when a class is derived from struct
            };
            int main(){    
                B b;
                //std::cout << "b number : " << b.number << std::endl; error
                return 0;
            }


Note : 
It's even possible to have a class derive from a struct. (or vice versa). In this case, the default inheritance is controlled by the child, so a struct that derives from a class will default to public inheritance, and a class that derives from a struct will have private inheritance by default.
