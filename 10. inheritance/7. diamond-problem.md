#### cpp supports multiple inheritance

> if subclass inherit method with same name from multiple base classes, diamon problem arise.
(method ambiguity about which one has to consider)

#### solving diamond problem with virtual function in base class


Virtual inheritance is a C++ technique that ensures only one copy of a base class's member variables are inherited by grandchild derived classes.
