### Virtual inheritance ensures only one copy of a base class's member variables are inherited by grandchild derived classes. 

#### cpp supports multiple inheritance

> if subclass inherit method with same name from multiple base classes, diamon problem arise.
(method ambiguity about which one has to consider)


        #include <iostream>
        class Player{

                void play(){
                    std::cout << "play file" << std::endl;

        int main(){
            Mobile* mobile = new Mobile();

#### solving diamond problem with virtual function in base class
      declare pure virtual function in parent classes. 
      pure virutal function : no implementation
      child class inherit function from one of multiple base classes
      
                #include <iostream>
                using namespace std;
                class A{
                    public:
                        virtual void method() = 0;
                };
                class B : virtual A {
                    public:
                        virtual void method() = 0;
                };
                class C: virtual A {
                    public:
                        virtual void method() = 0;
                };
                class D : virtual B,C{
                    public:
                        void method(){
                                //it doesnot matter which method() class D inherits from B or C class            
                        }
                };


Virtual inheritance is a C++ technique that ensures only one copy of a base class's member variables 
are inherited by grandchild derived classes. 



#### Example : child class overriding method inherited from one of multiple base classes


                #include<iostream>
                class A                     { public: void eat(){ std::cout<<"A" << std::endl ;} }; 
                class B: virtual public A   { public: void eat(){ std::cout<<"B" << std::endl ;} }; 
                class C: virtual public A   { public: void eat(){ std::cout<<"C" << std::endl ;} }; 
                class D: public         B,C { public: void eat(){ std::cout<<"D" << std::endl ;} }; 
                class Player                { public : void play(){ std::cout << "play";}};
                class MusicPlayer : virtual public Player           { public : void play(){ std::cout << "music player" << std::endl;}};
                class VideoPlayer : virtual public Player           { public : void play(){ std::cout << "video player" << std::endl ;}};
                class Mobile : public MusicPlayer, VideoPlayer      { public : void play(){ std::cout << "mobile player" << std::endl;}};
                int main(){ 
                    A *a = new D(); 
                    a->eat(); 
                    Mobile* m = new Mobile();    
                    m->play();
                } 
                
                
                
                output :
                A
                Mobile player
