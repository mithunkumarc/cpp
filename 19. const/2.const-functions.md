A function becomes const when const keyword is used in functionâ€™s declaration. 
The idea of const functions is not allow them to modify the object on which they are called.




        #include<iostream>
        class Test
        {    
            public:
            int number = 10;
            int getNumber() const {
                //number = 100;           //compile error, doesnt allow to change the status of object
                return number;
            }
        };
        int main()
        {   
            Test* test = new Test();
            std::cout << "number : " << test->getNumber() << std::endl;
            return 0;
        }
