This allows creating lambda captures initialized with arbitrary expressions. 
The name given to the captured value does not need to be related to any variables in the enclosing scopes and introduces a new name inside the lambda body. 
The initializing expression is evaluated when the lambda is created (not when it is invoked).

        int factory(int i) { return i * 10; }
        auto f = [x = factory(2)] { return x; }; // x = 20 , returns 20

        auto generator = [x = 0] () mutable {
          // this would not compile without 'mutable' as we are modifying x on each call
          return x++;
        };
        auto a = generator(); // == 0
        auto b = generator(); // == 1
        auto c = generator(); // == 2


caputure by value can be reinitialized using mutalble keyword 

          int i = 10;
          auto identity = [=]() mutable {i=20;};
          identity();
          std::cout << i << std::endl; //still i = 10, (by value)
