A friend class can access both private and protected members of the class in which it has been declared as friend.


          #include <iostream>  

          using namespace std;  

          class A  
          {   
              private:
                int x =5;  
              friend class B;           // friend class.  B can access A private and protected properties
          };  
          class B  
          {  
            public:  
              void display(A &a)  
              {  
                  cout<<"value of x is : "<<a.x;  // b is reading A's private property
              }  
          };  
          int main()  
          {  
              A a;  
              B b;  
              b.display(a);  
              return 0;  
          }  
    

            output :

            value of x is : 5
