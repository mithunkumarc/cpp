Preprocessor Directives : 

Preprocessor programs provides preprocessors directives which tell the compiler to preprocess the source code before compiling. 

All of these preprocessor directive begins with a ‘#’ (hash) symbol. 

This (‘#’) symbol at the beginning of a statement in a C/C++ program indicates that it is a pre-processor directive. 

We can place these pre processor directives anywhere in our program. 

Examples of some preprocessor directives are: #include, #define, #ifndef etc.

> 4 main types of directives are 

    Macros
    File Inclusion
    Conditional Compilation
    Other directives


advantage of Macros over function :

        The advantage of the macro is during the time of preprocessing 
        the calling macro place will be replace with macro definition so compilation 
        time will be little more but execution time will be less.


#### Macros : 

Macros are piece of code in a program which is given some name.

Whenever this name is encountered by the compiler the compiler replaces the name with the actual piece of code.

> The ‘#define’ directive is used to define a macro. 

        #include <iostream>
        //macro definition
        #define LIMIT 5
        int main(){
          for(int i = 0; i < LIMIT ; i ++){
              std::cout << i << std::endl;
          }
        }
        
        output : 0 1 2 3 4 


> The "#undef" directive : Undefines macro which was previously defined with a #define directive.

      #include<iostream>
      #define TEMP 10

      #ifdef TEMP 
        #undef TEMP
        #define TEMP 25
      #else
        #define TEMP 30
      #endif

      int main(){
        std::cout << "temp value is : " << TEMP << std::endl;
      }
    
      output : temp value is : 25
    
---        
        
#### Macros with arguments

      #include <iostream>
      //macro definition
      #define AREA(l,b) (l*b)
      int main(){
        int l1 = 10, l2 = 5, area;
        area = AREA(l1,l2);
        std::cout << "Area of rectangle is : " << area;
        return 0;
      }
      
      output : 
      Area of rectangle is : 50

#### File inclusion : including header files

#### conditional compilation/inclusion : (#ifdef, #ifndef, #if, #endif, #else and #elif)

 
 Conditional Compilation directives are type of directives which helps to compile a specific portion of the program or 
 to skip compilation of some specific part of the program based on some conditions. 
 
> if else:
 
        #include <iostream>
        #define SIZE 99

        int main(){
          #if SIZE > 99
            std::cout << "size is greater than 99" << std::endl;
          #elif SIZE < 99
            std::cout << "size is less than 99" << std::endl;
          #else
            std::cout << "equal to 99" << std::endl;
          #endif

          return 0;
        }
      
        output : 
        equal to 99
        


> ifndef : if a macro is not defined , we can create in code

        #include <iostream>
        #define SIZE 99

        int main(){
          #ifndef PI
            #define PI 3.14
            std::cout << "PI not define here" << std::endl;
          #else
            std::cout << "PI : " << PI << std::endl;
          #endif

          //else block executed
          #ifndef PI
            #define PI 3.14
          #else
            std::cout << " value of PI : " << PI << std::endl;
          #endif


          return 0;
        }

        output :
        PI not define here
        value of PI : 3.14
