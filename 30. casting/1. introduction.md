#### primitive types
      implicit conversion : 
        downcasting
            int i = 100;
            short s = i;
        
        overflow :
            int i = 345678;
            short s = i;


        upcasting
            short s = 100;
            int i = s;

        explicit conversion
            short a = 2000;
            int b;
            b = (int) a;

    
#### implicit conversion : on classes

        #include <iostream>
        #include <typeinfo> //for std::bad_cast

        class A {};
        class B { public: B (A a) {} };
        class C { public: C (B b) {} };
        int main(){
            //Implicit conversions also include constructor or operator conversions
            A a;
            B b=a;
            C c = b;
        }
        

#### dynamic_casting (similar to explicit casting)

>  dynamic_cast can be used only with pointers and references to objects. 
   Its purpose is to ensure that the result of the type conversion is a valid complete object of the requested class.
   
   
      #include <iostream>
      class CBase{};
      class CDerived : public CBase{};

      int main(){
          //dynamic cast    
          CBase b;
          CBase* pb;
          CDerived d; 
          CDerived* pd;
          pb = dynamic_cast<CBase*>(&d);//upcasting possible
          pd = dynamic_cast<CDerived*>(&b);//error , base to derived not possible
      }
