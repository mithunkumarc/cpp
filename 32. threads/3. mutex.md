mutex: Mutual exclusion

similar to synchronized block , 
mutual exclusion is used to lock on block of code so that no other code can modify current thread status.


### without mutex lock : task 1 and task 2 overlaps

          #include <iostream>
          #include <thread>
          //#include <mutex>

          //std::mutex mtx; //mutex for critical

          void print_block(int n, char c){
              //critical section, apply sync
              //first thread will get lock , no other thread can access until current thread completes task
              //mtx.lock();
              for(int i = 0; i < n ; i ++) {
                  std::cout << c;
              }
              //mtx.unlock();
          }


          int main(){
              std::thread th1 (print_block, 500, '*');
              std::thread th2 (print_block, 500, '$');

              th1.join();
              th2.join();

              return 0;
          }
          
          compile : 
          g++ -std=c++17 Test.cpp -pthread
          
          execute :
          ./a.out
          
          output :

### with mutex lock : 

          #include <iostream>
          #include <thread>
          #include <mutex>

          std::mutex mtx; //mutex for critical

          void print_block(int n, char c){
              //critical section, apply sync
              //first thread will get lock , no other thread can access until current thread completes task
              mtx.lock();
              for(int i = 0; i < n ; i ++) {
                  std::cout << c;
              }
              mtx.unlock();
          }


          int main(){
              std::thread th1 (print_block, 500, '*');
              std::thread th2 (print_block, 500, '$');

              th1.join();
              th2.join();

              return 0;
          }
