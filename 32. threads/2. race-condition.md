Let us imagine that x * x is a very costly operation (it's not, but use your imagination)
and we want to calculate the sum of squares up to a certain number. 
It would make sense to parallelize the calulation of each square across threads. 
We can do something like this:

        #include <iostream>
        #include <vector>
        #include <thread>

        int accum = 0;

        void square(int x){
            accum += x * x;    
        }
        int main(){
            std::vector<std::thread> ths;
            for(int i = 1; i <= 20 ;i++){
                ths.push_back(std::thread(&square,i));
            }
            for(auto& th : ths){
                th.join();
            }

            std::cout << "accum = " << accum << std::endl;
            return 0;
        }
        
        output : 
        compile :  g++ -std=c++17 Test.cpp -pthread
        execute :  ./a.out
        
        accum = 2870



* task splitted and joined at the end , similar to fork and join
