C++11 is the latest C++ standard that was published in 2011. 
Before it was published, it was known as C++0x. 
There are still plenty of old references using this name and you should consider them synonymous. 


Currently, GCC 4.8.1 supports almost all core features of C++11 (GCC C++11 status). 

multithreading added in c++ 11

#### creating thread with function

        #include <iostream>
        #include <thread>
        void func(int x){
            std::cout << "inside thread, input : " << x << std::endl;
        }

        int main(){
            std::thread th(&func, 100);
            th.join();
            std::cout << "outside thread" << std::endl;
            return 0;
        }
        
        * Compile command :  g++ -std=c++0x Test.cpp -pthread       //c++0x : old name for c++11
                             g++ -std=c++11 Test.cpp -pthread
                             g++ -std=c++14 Test.cpp -pthread
                             g++ -std=c++17 Test.cpp -pthread
                             
        * We also have to specify -pthread, 
          since the implementation for our GCC uses something called pthreads as its backend. Make sure it compiles and runs.                             
        
        * execute : ./a.out
                              
        
        ouput : 
        inside thread, input : 100
        outside thread

#### get_id of thread


            #include <iostream>
            #include <thread>
            void func(int x){
                std::cout << std::this_thread::get_id() << " : inside thread, input : " << x << std::endl;
            }

            int main(){
                std::thread th(&func, 100);                
                std::cout << std::this_thread::get_id() <<  " : outside thread" << std::endl;
                th.join();              // imp :  The function returns when the thread execution has completed.
                return 0;
            }

            command : 
                        
            output : run two three times , output may be jumbled
            140257563846464 : outside thread
            140257545651968 : inside thread, input : 100
