       
        [] - captures nothing.
        [=] - capture local objects (local variables, parameters) in scope by value.
        [&] - capture local objects (local variables, parameters) in scope by reference.
        [this] - capture this pointer by value.
        [a, &b] - capture objects a by value, b by reference.


[&] : capture by reference : value can be changed

        int x = 100;
        auto getX = [&] () {x = 200;};    //anonymous function : working as pass by reference
        getX();
        std::cout << x << std::endl;
        
        output : 200
        
        * above function is similar to writing a function outside main and receving param as reference


[=] : capture by value : value cannot be changed

          int x = 50;
          auto getX = [=] () {x = 200;};    //error, value cannot be changed
          std::cout << getX() << std::endl;
          std::cout <<"after funciton call : " <<  x << std::endl;
          
          ---
          
         int x = 50;
         auto getX = [=] () {return x + x;};
         std::cout << getX() << std::endl;
         std::cout <<"after funciton call : " <<  x << std::endl;
         
         output : 
         
         100
         output  : 50   //after calling lambda function, value of x is still same

[this] : capture this pointer by value. , used in class, struct or union


        #include<iostream>
        struct Circle{
            public:
              int radius;
              int getArea(){
                auto result =  [this](){return 2*3.14*this->radius;};
                return result();
              }
        };
        int main(){    
          Circle c;
          c.radius = 5;
          std::cout << "area of circle :  "<< c.getArea() << std::endl;
          return 0;
        }

         output : 
         area of circle :  31
