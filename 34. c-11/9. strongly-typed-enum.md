Type-safe enums that solve a variety of problems with C-style 
enums including: implicit conversions, inability to specify the underlying type, scope pollution.

        // Specifying underlying type as `unsigned int`
        enum class Color : unsigned int { Red = 0xff0000, Green = 0xff00, Blue = 0xff };
        // `Red`/`Green` in `Alert` don't conflict with `Color`
        enum class Alert : bool { Red, Green };
        Color c = Color::Red;
