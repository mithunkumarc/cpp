    Sequence Containers:  implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.
        vector
        list
        deque
        arrays
        forward_list( Introduced in C++11)
    Container Adaptors :  provide a different interface for sequential containers.
        queue
        priority_queue
        stack
    Associative Containers :  implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
        set
        multiset
        map
        multimap
