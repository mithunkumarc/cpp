Sequence Containers:  implement data structures which can be accessed in a sequential manner.

        vector
        list
        deque
        arrays
        forward_list( Introduced in C++11)
    
Container Adaptors :  provide a different interface for sequential containers.

        queue
        priority_queue
        stack
    
Associative Containers :  implement sorted data structures that can be quickly searched (O(log n) complexity).
        
        set
        multiset
        map
        multimap
