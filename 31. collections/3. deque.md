inserted and removed from both ends

Double ended queues are sequence containers

They are similar to vectors, but are more efficient in case of insertion and deletion of elements at the end, and also the beginning. 

Unlike vectors, contiguous storage allocation may not be guaranteed.

The functions for deque are same as vector, with an addition of push and pop operations for both front and back.



        #include <iostream>
        #include <deque>

        void showdq(std::deque <int> g){
            std::deque <int> :: iterator it;
            for(it = g.begin() ; it!=g.end(); it++){
                std::cout << '\t' << *it;//like deferencing pointer
            }
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }

        int main(){
            std::deque <int> g;
            g.push_back(10);
            g.push_back(20);
            g.push_back(30);
            g.push_front(40);
            g.push_front(50);
            g.push_front(60);
            std::cout << "displaying dequd" << std::endl;
            showdq(g);
            
            std::cout << "size : " << g.size() << std::endl;
            
            std::cout << "element at index 2 : " << g.at(2) << std::endl;
            
            std::cout << "front : " << g.front() << std::endl;
            
            std::cout << "back : " << g.back() << std::endl;
            
            g.pop_front();
            std::cout << "after pop front method" << std::endl;
            showdq(g);
            
            g.pop_back();

            showdq(g);

            return 0;
        }


        output:
