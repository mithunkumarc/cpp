:: scope resolution operator helps to define member function outside class.


        #include<iostream>
        class Student{
            public:
                static std::string schoolName;
                std::string studentName;//non static data may not be defined outside class
                void attendence();
        };

        std::string Student::schoolName = "CBSE school";
        //std::string Student::studentName = "vinay"; error
        void Student::attendence(){
            std::cout << "student attendence " << std::endl;
        }

        int main(){       
            Student* student = new Student();
            student->studentName = "vinay";
            std::cout << "school name : " << student->schoolName << std::endl;
            student->attendence();
            return 0;
        }

        output : 
        school name : CBSE school
        student attendence
