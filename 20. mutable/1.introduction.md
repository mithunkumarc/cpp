mutable keyword is used with member variables of class, which we want to change even if the object is of const type. 
Hence, mutable data members of a const objects can be modified.

        #include<iostream>
        class Test
        {    
            public:
            mutable int number = 10;  
            int count = 20;  
        };
        int main()
        {   
            const Test* test = new Test();    
            test->number = 11;
            // test->count = 21;    //error , cannot change the status of const object unless it is mutable
            return 0;
        }
