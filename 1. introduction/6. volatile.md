#### local variable vs volative variable

> similar in using but compiler optimize local var but not volatile. 
  compiler doesnt assume value of volative every time it executes

#### local variable : compiler may do some optimiztion to speed up execution

          int some_int = 100;

          while(some_int == 100)  //may be this line replaced with true
          {
             //your code
          }
          
          
#### volatile variable : no optimization on volative variable , because it can be changed from other process or thread

          volatile int some_int = 100; //no optimization
