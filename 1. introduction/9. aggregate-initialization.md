aggregate initialization means the use of brace-enclosed initializer 
lists to initialize all members of an aggregate 
(i.e. an array or struct [in C++, only certain types of structs count as aggregates]).

use for array/ struct / union:              (apped to class? : doubt)

        #include <iostream>
        #include <array>
        struct s{
            int x;
            struct Foo{
                int i;
                int j;
                int a[3];
            }b;
        };
        int main(){
            s s1 = {1,{1,2,{4,5,6}}};    
        }
