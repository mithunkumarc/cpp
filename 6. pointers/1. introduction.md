Usage of pointer

There are many usage of pointers in C++ language.

    1) Dynamic memory allocation

    In c language, we can dynamically allocate memory using malloc() and calloc() functions where pointer is used.

    2) Arrays, Functions and Structures

    Pointers in c language are widely used in arrays, functions and structures. It reduces the code and improves the performance.
