#### auto  : by default all local variables are auto.
> auto i = 10; // no need to specify datatype, compiler will do it depending on data.

> auto i; //error , must be initialized
 
#### register : 
> The register variable allocates memory in register than RAM. 

> Its size is same of register size. It has a faster access than other variables.

> It is recommended to use register variable only for quick access such as in counter.

> Note: We can't get the address of register variable. and limiter number of registers.     
 
     register int i;
     i = 10;
     cout << i;
 
#### Mutable : 
    The data members of a constant object or struct cannot be changed. 
    If we want some data members to change even when the object is constant, it can be using mutable keyword. 
    
      #include <iostream>
      #include <string.h>
      using std::cout;
      using std::endl;

      int main()
      {
          const struct{
              int n1;
              mutable int n2;
           } x = {0, 0};      // const object with mutable member
           //x.n1 = 100;      // error, variable of const struct cannot be changed unlesss marked as mutable
           x.n2 = 200;        //works fine because marked as mutable
           cout << x.n1 << endl;
           cout << x.n2 << endl;
           return 0;
      }
    
      output : x1 : 0
               x2 : 200
               
#### Static :
> The static variable is initialized only once and exists till the end of a program. 

> It retains its value between multiple functions call.

> The static variable has the default value 0 which is provided by compiler.


        #include <iostream>
        #include <string.h>
        using std::cout;
        using std::endl;

        void increment(){
            static int i = 0;
            i += 1;
            cout << i << endl;
        }


        int main()
        {
             increment();
             increment();
             increment();
             return 0;
        }
        
        output : 
        1
        2
        3

#### external : 
> The extern variable is visible to all the programs. 

> It is used if two or more files are sharing same variable or function.

> compile both file together  
         
###### 1. file : Test.cpp
         
         #include <iostream>
         extern int count;
         void write_extern(void) {
            std::cout << "Count is " << count << std::endl;
         }
 
##### 2. file : user.cpp
         
         #include <iostream>
         int count ;
         extern void write_extern();

         main() {
            count = 5;
            write_extern();
         }
 
 ###### output : command to execute
