#### auto  : by default all local variables are auto.
> gcc compiler on ubuntu may not support auto keyword.
 
#### register : 
> The register variable allocates memory in register than RAM. 

> Its size is same of register size. It has a faster access than other variables.

> It is recommended to use register variable only for quick access such as in counter.

> Note: We can't get the address of register variable. and limiter number of registers.     
 
     register int i;
     i = 10;
     cout << i;
 
#### Mutable : 
The data members of a constant object cannot be changed. 
If we want some data members to change even when the object is constant, it can be using mutable keyword.
