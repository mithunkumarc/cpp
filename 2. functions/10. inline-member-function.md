A member function that is defined inside its class member list is called an inline member function


            #include<iostream>
            //inline member function
            class Gmail{
                public:
                    void sendMail();
                inline void Gmail::sendMail(){
                    std::cout << "sending email ... " << std::endl;
                }    
            };
            int main(){           
                return 0;
            }
