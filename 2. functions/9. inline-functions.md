Inline functions are used to increase the speed of execution of executable files.

An inline functin is a function whose compiled code is 'in line' with the rest of 
program. That is, the compiler replaces the function call with the corresponding 
function code.

with inline code, the program does not have to jump to another location to execute
the code and jump back. Inline functions, thus, run a little faster than regular
functions.



        #include<iostream>
        inline double cube(double x) { return x*x*x; }                    
        int main(){        
            std::cout << cube(3) << std::endl;
            std::cout << cube(7) << std::endl;
            return 0;
        }

        output : 
        27
        343
